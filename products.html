	<h2>Firewall</h2>

<p>
	a firewall is a network security system that monitors and controls incoming and outgoing network traffic based on predetermined security rules. A firewall typically establishes a barrier between a trusted internal network and untrusted outside network, such as the Internet

<h2>First generation: packet filters</h2>	
<p>First generation: packet filters[edit]

Screenshot of Gufw: The firewall shows its settings for incoming and outgoing traffic.
The first reported type of network firewall is called a packet filter. Packet filters look at network addresses and ports of packets to determine if they must be allowed, dropped, or rejected.[16] The first paper published on firewall technology was in 1988, when engineers from Digital Equipment Corporation (DEC) developed filter systems known as packet filter firewalls. This fairly basic system is the first generation of what later became a highly involved and technical Internet security feature. At AT&T Bell Labs, Bill Cheswick and Steve Bellovin continued their research in packet filtering and developed a working model for their own company based on their original first generation architecture.
Packet filters act by inspecting packets which transfer between computers on the Internet. When a packet does not match the packet filter's set of filtering rules, the packet filter either drops (silently discards) the packet, or rejects the packet (discards it and generate an Internet Control Message Protocol notification for the sender). Conversely, when a packet matches one or more programmed filter rules, it is allowed to pass. Elements that can be defined in a packet filter rule include a packet's source and destination addresses, protocol, and source and destination ports. The bulk of Internet communication in 20th and early 21st century used either Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) and User Datagram Protocol (UDP) in conjunction with well-known port, enabling firewalls of that era to distinguish between, and thus control, specific types of traffic (such as web browsing, remote printing, email transmission, file transfer), unless the machines on each side of the packet filter used the same non-standard ports</p>
<h2>Second generation: "stateful" filters</h2>
<p>From 1989–1990 three colleagues from AT&T Bell Laboratories, Dave Presotto, Janardan Sharma, and Kshitij Nigam, developed the second generation of firewalls, calling them circuit-level gateways.

Second-generation firewalls perform the work of their first-generation predecessors but operate up to layer 4 (transport layer) of the OSI model. This is achieved by retaining packets until enough information is available to make a judgement about its state. Known as stateful packet inspection, it records all connections passing through it and determines whether a packet is the start of a new connection, a part of an existing connection, or not part of any connection. Though static rules are still used, these rules can now contain connection state as one of their test criteria.

Certain denial-of-service attacks bombard the firewall with thousands of fake connection packets in an attempt to overwhelm it by filling its connection state memory.</p>
<h2>Virtual private network</h2>
<p>
	A virtual private network (VPN) extends a private network across a public network, and enables users to send and receive data across shared or public networks as if their computing devices were directly connected to the private network. Applications running across the VPN may therefore benefit from the functionality, security, and management of the private network.
